# What is data visualization?

[Claus O. Wilke – Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)

* *Data visualization is part art and part science.*

* *The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong and vice versa.*

* *A data visualization first and foremost has to accurately convey the data. It must not mislead or distort.*

# Planning

- **Develop your research question**
- **Get or create your data**
  - [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](https://themanoftalent.medium.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-learning-json-27e507f7c6f), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [GPKG](https://www.geopackage.org), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/howitworks.html), etc.
- **Clean and prepare your data**
  - Removing unnecessary variables
  - Deleting duplicate rows/observations
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Standardizing or categorizing values
  - Format columns appropriately
  - Convert values into appropriate units
  - Filter your data
  - Extract values from complex columns
  - Combine variables to create new columns

::right::

- **Choose the right tools**
  - What is the goal of your visualization?
  - Who is your audience?
  - How will they use the visualization?
- **Choose the chart type**
  - How variables compare to each other?
  - Relationships between variables?
  - Patterns in the data?
- **Create chart**
  - Import data into the software
  - Select the chart type you wish to create
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the chart
  - Refine by applying design principles

# Data Experiment (Revisited)

### Mission
- Team up with your neighbor and collect **5 minutes** of live data from the room.
- Examples:
  - How many items are blue?
  - How many times does someone clear one's throat in 5 minutes?
  - Average number of tabs open on laptops

Then quickly sketch how you would visualize it!

**Important:**
- Can be done analog or digitally
- Be sure to collect the data in a way that you can analyze it later.

# Exercise – Pick a Tool & Play

Learn the basic principles of chart visualization

### Steps:
1. Pick a tool (e.g., RAWGraphs, Datawrapper, Excel, etc.)
2. Pick a dataset (e.g., [data.gv.at](http://data.gv.at), [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com), etc.) or use the classroom dataset
3. Create a chart or visualization

Work alone or in pairs

# Let’s Get Started
## Build Your Data Project

## Step 1: Idea Speed Dating

- Everyone brainstorms 2–3 rough ideas or interests (datasets, topics, tools you want to explore)
- 5-minute speed rounds: Form round of 3 people
  - Each person has 1 minute to pitch their idea
  - After 3 minutes, switch partners
- Take notes: Which ideas resonate with you? Who shares your interests?


## Step 2: Form Your Crew

- Find people you clicked with or who liked similar ideas
- Groups of **max. 4** people

::right::

## Step 3: Mission

Each group creates a mini project plan:

- **Topic or theme:** What moves you?
- **Dataset:** What existing data can you use? Or do you want to collect your own?
- **Question:** What do you want to find out, show, criticize, imagine?
- **Moodboard:** What is the style of your project? What do you want to achieve?
- **First sketch:** Rough idea of a visualization or data artwork

Prepare a **short informal presentation** for tomorrow (5–10 min):

- What data did you choose?
- What is your artistic/research question?
- How do you want to visualize the data?
- What are your next steps?
