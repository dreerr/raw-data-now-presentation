# What is data visualization?

[Claus O. Wilke – Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)

* *Data visualization is part art and part science.*

* *The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong and vice versa.*

* *A data visualization first and foremost has to accurately convey the data. It must not mislead or distort.*

# Planning

- Develop your research question
- Get or create your data
  - [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](https://themanoftalent.medium.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-learning-json-27e507f7c6f), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [GPKG](https://www.geopackage.org), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), etc.
- Clean your data
  - Removing unnecessary variables
  - Deleting duplicate rows/observations
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Standardizing or categorizing values
- Choose the chart type
  - How variables compare to each other?
  - Relationships between variables?
  - Patterns in the data?

::right::

- Choose your tool
- Prepare data
  - Format columns appropriately
  - Convert values into appropriate units
  - Filter your data
  - Group data and create aggregate values for groups
  - Extract values from complex columns
  - Combine variables to create new columns
- Create chart
  - Import data into the software
  - Select the chart type you wish to create
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the chart
  - Refine by applying design principles

# Game: Invent a Crazy Dataset

In pairs or small groups:
- Invent a dataset that does not exist yet but should!

Examples:
- Dataset of forgotten birthday gifts
- Dataset of moon-gazing minutes
- Dataset of socks lost in washing machines

**Outcome:** Quick creative thinking!

# Group work
## Research, retrieve and explore datasets

**Main objectives:**

- Form groups of max. 5 people
- Select a dataset
- Formulate a research question or theme
- Prepare a short presentation (5-10 min) of your project idea
  - What dataset did you choose?
  - What is your research question?
  - How do you want to visualize the data?
  - What tools do you want to use?
  - What are your next steps?
