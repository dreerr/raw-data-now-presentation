# Day 1 — Tuesday
## Introduction & Artistic Perspectives on Data

---

# Welcome & introduction to the workshop

*This workshop offers an introduction to the artistic engagement with raw data — from analysis and processing to visualization. Together, we will examine how data can be used as material to create new perspectives and forms of expression.*

## Main goals:
- Explore the potential of data as a medium for artistic expression
- Learn about data analysis, visualization, and storytelling techniques
- Develop a project idea that uses data as a starting point
- Create a prototype or first draft of your project

## Workshop format:
- **Hands-on**: We will work together on projects, share ideas, and learn from each other.
- **Collaborative**: We will work in small groups, share feedback, and support each other.

# Bewegungsstudie einer Computermaus

A program records cursor movements without context, resulting in unexpectedly expressive patterns – like bird tracks in snow – that reflect the complexity, unpredictability, and individuality of our actions and intentions.

# Data completion round

Everyone briefly introduces themselves and their interests

- In this workshop I'm interested in…
- I want to learn more about…
- Generally I am really good at…

**Additionally**, please complete your information in the [shared folder](https://base.uni-ak.ac.at/cloud/index.php/f/21006623).

# Data Experiment

### Mission
- Team up with your neighbor and collect **5 minutes** of live data from the room.
- Examples:
  - How many items are blue?
  - How many times does someone clear one's throat in 5 minutes?
  - Average number of tabs open on laptops

Then quickly sketch how you would visualize it!

**Important:**
- Do this without any digital tools!
- Be sure to collect the data in a way that you can analyze it later.
