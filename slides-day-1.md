# Day 1 — Tuesday
## Introduction & Artistic Perspectives on Data


---

# Welcome & introduction to the workshop

*This workshop offers an introduction to the artistic engagement with raw data — from analysis and processing to visualization. Together, we will examine how data can be used as material to create new perspectives and forms of expression.*

## Main goals:
- Explore the potential of data as a medium for artistic expression
- Learn about data analysis, visualization, and storytelling techniques
- Develop a project idea that uses data as a starting point
- Create a prototype or first draft of your project

## Workshop format:
- **Hands-on**: We will work together on projects, share ideas, and learn from each other.
- **Collaborative**: We will work in small groups, share feedback, and support each other.

# Bewegungsstudie einer Computermaus

A program records cursor movements without context, resulting in unexpectedly expressive patterns – like bird tracks in snow – that reflect the complexity, unpredictability, and individuality of our actions and intentions.

# Data completion round

Everyone briefly introduces themselves and their interests

- In this workshop I'm interested in…
- I want to learn more about…
- Generally I am really good at…

# Activity: Data Experiment

**Mini-mission:**

- In small groups, collect **5 minutes** of live data from the room.
- Examples:
  - How many items are blue?
  - How many times does someone smile in 5 minutes?
  - Average number of tabs open on laptops

Then quickly sketch how you would visualize it!

**Important:**
- Do this without any digital tools!
- Be sure to collect the data in a way that you can analyze it later.

# Data Aesthetics – What Makes it Beautiful?

### [Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase)

Each group picks 2–3 visualizations from the links above and analyze them through the following lenses:
  - *Form* – What visual metaphors or design principles are used?
  - *Function* – Is it clear? Informative? Overwhelming?
  - *Feeling* – What emotion or atmosphere does it evoke?
  - *Fiction* – Could this visualization also be a *story* or *artwork*?
